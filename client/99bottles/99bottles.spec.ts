describe('99 Bottles of Beer', () => {
    /*
     * Do we care about plurality? Human readability? YES
     * I'm going to loop 99-ish times. When I'm done I have a final statement
     *
     * 1. The last VERSE of the song is always:
     *  "No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.
     *   Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall."
     * 2. The song has 99 verses plus the final one.
     * 3. The song starts at the verse containing 99 bottles
     * 4. The song goes on by decrementing the number of bottles in each verse
     * 5. If we have more than one bottle, it is 'bottles', instead of 'bottle'.
     * 6. The basic verse structure is: "X bottles of beer on the wall, X bottles of beer
     *                                   Take one down and pass it around, X-1 bottle(s) of beer on the wall"
     * 7. A number next the word bottle, possibly with an s (ie. bottles) for plural meanings.
